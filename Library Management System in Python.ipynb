    "##  Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates a **basic Library Management System** implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It showcases the use of custom classes, method definitions, and object manipulation in a realistic scenario. The key goals of this project are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design a `Book` class with validation for ISBN-13 numbers.\n",
    "- Create and manage book objects.\n",
    "- Implement a `Library` class that uses a dictionary-like structure to manage books.\n",
    "- Provide core functionalities such as adding, removing, borrowing, and returning books.\n",
    "- Demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, and error handling in an intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is suitable for **beginner to intermediate Python learners**, especially those looking to apply OOP concepts to practical, real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Book Class Implementation**  \n",
    "   Defines book attributes, `__str__()` method, and an ISBN-13 validation method based on checksum logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Book Creation and Validation**  \n",
    "   Demonstrates the instantiation of multiple `Book` objects and checks their ISBN-13 validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Library Class Implementation**  \n",
    "   Implements a class that inherits from `dict`, using ISBNs as keys and `Book` objects as values. Includes methods to add, remove, borrow, and return books safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Library Demonstration**  \n",
    "   Shows the use of all methods in action, handling edge cases like invalid ISBNs or borrowing unavailable books.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "- Basic string and numeric validation\n",
    "- Console-based outputs for demonstration\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully simulates a **Library Management System** using Python's object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Key Functionalities Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ISBN Validation:**  \n",
    "  All books were checked for valid ISBN-13 formats using checksum logic. Invalid entries were prevented from being added to the library, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Book Management:**  \n",
    "  A custom `Library` class was implemented, inheriting from Python’s built-in `dict`. It allowed:\n",
    "  - Adding books with valid ISBNs.\n",
    "  - Preventing addition of books with invalid ISBNs (e.g., Davis' Guide and Encyclopedia of the Great Apes).\n",
    "  - Borrowing a book, which correctly decremented the available copy count.\n",
    "  - Returning a book, which incremented the copy count.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Output Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system displayed **error messages** for invalid ISBNs, confirming robust validation.\n",
    "- Borrowing and returning operations **reflected real-time updates** in available copies.\n",
    "- Final output lists all books in the library with their updated availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Learning Highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usage of `__str__()` to override object print behavior.\n",
    "- Input validation via custom methods.\n",
    "- Dictionary-based data structures for efficient book lookup and management.\n",
    "- Clear separation of class responsibilities and realistic simulation of borrowing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project lays a solid foundation for developing more complex management systems and reinforces core OOP principles such as encapsulation, validation, and class-based design.\n"
